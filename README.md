DESCRIPTION
--------
  This application is for a budget calculator. With this, users will be able to
sign-up, in, out, and change passwords. Once signed-in, users will be able
to input cashflow items by entering the name and value of the cashflow.
The API will store inputs associated with the user, and give them the option to
change or delete inputs. The net result of all inputs will be calculated for
the user on the front-end of the application.
